# EstelaLama_PyGame

We completed a programming exercise in our Python class where we developed a program that "predicts" human behavior using a simple game. The game consists of a human player and a computer that can choose to play either 0 or 1. The computer receives a point if both players choose the same numbers. The human player receives a point if the numbers chosen are different. Plays are performed n times. The player with the most points at the end of n moves is the winner. A simple "machine learning" method is used to implement the strategy for the computer to "guess" the human player's bid. The learning is influenced by the previous move. The goal was also to keep our code less than 250 lines.
